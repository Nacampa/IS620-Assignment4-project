The data was found at www.imdb.com
The Movie database consists of movie title, length in minutes, year released, avg rating and movie genre

Two nodes were created, one Movie with attributes movie title, year and rating
The second is Genre consisting of 7 Genres (Action, Animation, Comedy, Drama, Documentary, Romance and Short

An edge is created linking Movie and Genra based on a 0,1 entry in file
with Edge properties: year and rating

Two centrality measures are calculated: Degree and Eigenvector

Degree Centrality: Is a measure of the number of edges or links incident upon a node.
In Degree Centrality a nodes importance increases with the number of in or outbound edges
Inbound edges indicate popularity, output indicate influence
A specific node: Genre is important because there are many movies linked to that Genre

Eigenvector Centrality: Measures the importance of a node based on its connectivity to  other important nodes
It assigns numbers to each node based on this relationship

Example: 'Comedy' has high degree centrality and the 'Romance' has low degree centrality
A database with many 'Romantic Comedies' may have a higher relative 'Romance' eigenvector measure
by virtue of its associaton with the 'Comedy' 
Shorts may also have a higher eigenvector measure due to the association with Comedy or Drama


One sided T-tests have been run at a 99 percent CI alpha of .01 with CV: 3.143
                            and at a 95 percent CI alpha of .05 with CV: 1.943

Statistics have been gathered on a random sample of 150 data points
                              on a random sample of 300 data points
                        and for the entire db of 58,789 data points
